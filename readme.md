# Grounded Project

## About me
Hi, I'm Evania. 
I made this project as a final checkpoint for my software engineer program. 

## The Project
So, I made a website called Grounded, an online marketplace to buy organic body products. 
I used pure html, css and JS. 
You can visit the web here: 
- [Netlify](https://glittery-kheer-d65160.netlify.app/)
- [Github Pages](https://revou-fsse-5.github.io/module-2-evaniaanthony/)
- [Custom Domain](https://evaniajoycelin.site/)


__1. Navigation__ <br>
The Navigation is fixed. It's positioned relative to the browser window. This means that the element stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

The navigation bar is responsive. In phone view, the menu transforms into a hamburger button. You can toggle this button to show or hide the menu. I use JavaScript to achieve this functionality.

I also make a pop up modal (form) in Free Consultation. To achieve this I also using JavaScript.

__2. Main__ <br>
Then, I added a background image with content in the center. To center this content, I used the CSS property display: flex.

I also created a "Best Sellers" section that showcases the most frequently purchased products. To view all the products, you can scroll left or right, or use the navigation buttons. I use only CSS to achieve this, without any JS.

This how it will look like in mobile.

I also show a little explanation about grounded, with an image in the left.

When on the phone, you can see the image changes, I achieve this using srcset.

I also make section about product category. Using display grid, but as you can see the grid is symetrical.

In the phone it will look like this, the grid layout will change.

I also make a slider review, the slider will automatically slide, I use CSS animation to achieve this.
