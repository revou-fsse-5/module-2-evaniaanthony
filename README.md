# Wedding Invitation Project
Hi, nice to e-meet you!
I'm now taking module 2 on Revou FSSE Program. 
In this module I made wedding digital invitation, since many of my friends already got proposed. Happy for them!

You can see the full project on [here](https://revou-fsse-5.github.io/module-2-evaniaanthony/).

## The Project
1. __Apply the background image.__
    <br>
    I applied two backgrounds: a background color and a background image. I reduced the opacity of the background color using a pseudo-element, ensuring the content retains its original opacity.

    And how it will look like on phone, I also moved the navbar to the bottom

    __Psst, you will se a typing animation!__



2. __Apply the Responsive Image with picture + source + srcset method__
   <br>
    Can you spot the differences?

    On a desktop, the image has rounded borders, but on mobile, it doesn't. Additionally, the image displayed on desktop is different from the one shown on mobile. You can achieve this using picture + source + srcset method. 

3. __Apply the text shadow__
    I also applied the text shadow, to make the text more beautiful.

4. __Apply the grid__
    I also applied a grid layout to highlight the special moment. As you can see, the grid items aren't symmetrical. You can achieve this look using either a row grid or a column grid. __Psst you can scroll the bottom gallery!__

    And for the mobile layout, I also adjust the size and change some images, can you spot the differences?

    I also add some animation, when you hover the image, it will go bigger.
